# MVP

This is my MVP project. It aims to solve the problem that some people are afraid to ask a question because they are afraid about
what other people might think of them. The same goes for the person who tries to solve a problem but not so sure about their answer.
My project allows for those users to ask questions and reply to any questions as they please without worrying about what other people might think of them.
